\section{About}
Which elements of ecology should be known to any ecologist reaching MSc (or early PhD) level? Following \citet{Dormann2023}, we suggest to organise the topics by spatio-temporal scale (= level of organisation) from large to small. This repository aims at collecting and communicating ideas and links to resources (books, papers, MOOCs, videos) that help teaching (and learning) about a subject.

We recognise that opinions will differ about what to include as \emph{core} ecological topics. Take your pick and add your ideas! This is not aiming to be prescriptive or homogenising, but fostering a common language and knowledge base.

All material presented for download is open access for non-commercial use, unless stated otherwise.


\section{Introduction}
Within ecology, collaborations are key to understanding the beauty and complexity of nature, and for addressing urgent environmental problems. But how often did we experience collaborations thwarted by miscommunication and lack of a common language? We seem to work with loosely defined concepts and inconsistent vocabulary. Overcoming such problems starts with a well-trained new generation of ecologists. For them, a Canonical Ecology Curriculum is needed, focusing on core theories, seminal papers and standard methods used by ecologists.

Based on a conceptual and operational backbone, such a curriculum could be taught in graduate programmes worldwide, augmented by local examples, individual research interests and enthusiasm. It would minimize the ambiguity of what ecologists learn, while enriching our common vocabulary, reinforcing our ability to understand nature and address complex environmental issues. 

We call for a global, open collaboration to collectively develop the curriculum, and make it directly usable in real-world teaching. As a starting point, we provide eight central spatiotemporal themes, ranging from molecular to global, with recommendations on target variables, theories, classical studies, methods and teaching resources. 

If you are interested in joining our cause, take a look at, and comment on, the current version of our curriculum’s backbone (for more background reading see our paper in Basic and Applied Ecology):

\begin{itemize}
	\item Below the table, please link your teaching material to openly share with colleagues.
	\item If you miss something in the curriculum, please add this topic at the bottom of the text along with a justification.
	\item If you think something is not important enough for a core curriculum, please leave a similar note below the table to tell us why.
\end{itemize}
