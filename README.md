 # CanonicalEcologyCurriculum
Towards an international core curriculum for MSc Ecology

This branch ("main") hosts the .tex file from which the webpage (on "gh-pages") is compiled. Compilation is local, using "htlatex", which yields an .html and .css to upload onto .gh-pages. Note that the name is changed from CanonicalEcologyCurriculum.htlm to index.html for that purpose.

If you have teaching material, please upload and/or link it into the .tex file, or send me an email and I can do so.


Please contact Carsten Dormann carsten.dormann@biom.uni-freiburg.de for further information.
